#Django Library for serving Pandas Dataframe using REST API

Django REST Framework can be used to feed and generate Pandas Dataframe. For this purpose Django REST Pandas library can come handy. The API could be used to serve different file formats for consumption by a different visualization tool such as d3.js.

The basic idea behind Django REST Pandas is that it segregates data and presentation.

Django REST Pandas (DRP) does not use any JavaScript code, and task of implementing visualization is left to the developer. Therefore, most of the developers use this library along with the wq.app library, which facilitates a collection of charting tools and functions(i.e., wq/chart.js and wq/pandas.js), and data loaders which work well with CSV served by DRP.
